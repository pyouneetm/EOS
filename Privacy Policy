Privacy Policy for Minimalist Homepage
Last Updated: August 23, 2025

This privacy policy provides a detailed and transparent explanation of how the Minimalist Homepage Chrome extension ("the extension") handles your data. Your privacy is fundamental to the design and functionality of this extension.

1. Guiding Principle: Your Data is Yours
The core principle of this extension is that all your data is stored locally on your own computer. It never leaves your device, and we have no access to it.

2. What Information is Stored (Locally)
To save your customizations and preferences, the extension uses the browser's built-in local storage (chrome.storage.local). The data stored includes:

Custom Modes and Websites: Any modes you create and the website links you add to them.

To-Do List: The tasks you add to the to-do list widget.

Theme & Customization Settings: Your choices for background images (whether uploaded or from a URL), colors, gradients, and other visual settings.

Timer State: The current state of the study timer.

Music Player Playlist: A reference to the local music files you select to play. The audio files themselves are not stored by the extension, only the playlist order.

Again, all of this information is saved only on your local machine.

3. Information We Do Not Collect
The extension does not collect, transmit, or store any personal information or usage data. Specifically, we do not have access to:

Your browsing history.

Your search queries.

Your IP address or location.

Any analytics or usage statistics.

Any personal data from your Google account or other online accounts.

4. Permissions Explained
The manifest.json file requests only one permission:

"storage": This permission is required for the extension to save your settings locally. Without it, your custom modes, websites, and theme preferences would be lost every time you close the tab.

5. Third-Party Services & External Connections
Search Functionality: When you use the search bar, your query is sent directly to the search engine you have selected (e.g., Google, DuckDuckGo, YouTube). This is the same as performing a search directly on their websites. The extension does not intercept, log, or transmit your search queries to any other server.

No Third-Party Trackers: The extension does not include any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking scripts.

6. Changes to This Privacy Policy
If this policy is updated in the future, the changes will be detailed in the extension's description on the Chrome Web Store.

7. Contact Us
