Privacy Policy for Minimalist Homepage
Effective Date: August 28, 2025
This Privacy Policy describes how the Minimalist Homepage browser extension (the "Extension") handles your information. The core philosophy of this Extension is to be a private and secure space for you. It is designed to be completely open-source and does not track you in any way.
1. No Personal Data Collection
The Extension does not collect, store, transmit, or sell any of your personal information. We do not track your browsing history, your IP address, or any other data that could be used to identify you.
2. Data Stored Locally on Your Device
All settings and data generated by the Extension are stored exclusively on your local computer using your browser's built-in storage (chrome.storage.local). This data is never sent to any external server. This locally stored data includes:
Custom Modes & Websites: Any modes you create and websites you save for quick access.
Theme & Customization Settings: Your choices for background images, colors, fonts, and other UI preferences.
Notes: The content of the built-in notes widget.
Focus Timer & Purpose Widget: Your timer settings and the daily goal you set.
EOS News Reader Data: This includes the list of RSS feed sources (URLs and names) you add, your bookmarked articles, and a list of which articles you have read. This information is stored only on your device to power the news reader features and never leaves your computer. For example, the list of read articles is used solely to visually dim them in your feed.
Reader Mode Cache: To improve performance and provide offline access, the text content of articles you open in Reader Mode is cached locally on your device. This data is not transmitted anywhere.
3. Data Security
Because all your data is stored locally on your device, its security is tied to the security of your computer and your browser. The Extension does not implement separate encryption for your settings, relying on the security measures provided by your operating system and browser. We do not transmit your data over the internet, which eliminates the risk of interception during transmission.
4. Permissions Requested
The Extension requests the following permissions to function correctly:
storage: This permission is required to save your settings locally on your device, as described above.
<all_urls> (Host Permissions): This permission is necessary for the EOS News Reader feature. It allows the Extension's background script to fetch RSS feeds and article content from any URL that you provide. This is done on your behalf to bypass browser security restrictions (CORS) and does not involve tracking or sending your browsing data to any server.
5. Local File Access
Music Player: The local music player feature requires you to explicitly select a folder on your computer. The audio files from that folder are accessed and played directly by your browser. These files are never uploaded or transmitted anywhere.
Data Import/Export: The backup and restore features allow you to save your settings to a local file and import them later. This process is entirely local and does not involve sending data over the internet.
6. Third-Party Services and External Links
The Extension does not integrate with any third-party analytics or advertising services. All external connections are initiated directly by you. This includes:
Search Functionality: When you use the search bar, your query is sent directly to the search engine you have selected (e.g., Google, DuckDuckGo, Bing). The Extension does not log or store your search queries. Your interaction with the search engine is subject to their respective privacy policies.
RSS Feeds: When you add a feed to the EOS News Reader, the Extension contacts the server at the URL you provided to fetch the latest articles.
Donation Links: The settings panel contains external links to services like "Buy Me a Coffee" for voluntary donations. Clicking these links will navigate you to a third-party website, which is governed by its own privacy policy.
7. Disclaimer of Responsibility
The developer provides this Extension "as is" and is not responsible for how it is used. You, the user, are solely responsible for the content you access, add, or view using the Extension's features, including but not limited to the RSS feeds added to the EOS News Reader. The developer does not endorse and is not liable for any content accessed through the Extension.
8. Children's Privacy
This Extension is not directed at individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. Since the Extension does not collect personal data of any kind, it inherently does not collect data from children.
9. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
