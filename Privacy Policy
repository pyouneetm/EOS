Eos Extension Privacy Policy

Effective Date: October 31, 2025

Our Core Privacy Philosophy

Eos is designed from the ground up to be a completely private, offline-first application. Your data is your data.

We do not have a server. We do not have user accounts. We do not collect, store, transmit, or sell any of your personal information. We do not track you. We do not know who you are.

This policy explains what data you create, where it is stored, and the few specific, opt-in cases where your browser communicates with an external service.

1. Data You Store (100% Locally)

All data you create, save, or configure within the Eos extension suite is stored only on your local computer using your browser's localStorage and chrome.storage APIs.

This local-only data includes:

Eos New Tab: All your settings, custom themes, background preferences, modes, saved websites, focus timer state, purpose text, clock settings, UI font choices, and mode schedules.

EosScholar: Your Google Gemini API key, your username, all tasks in your To-Do List, all flashcard decks, your Pomodoro session history and goals, your study plans, and your entire AI chat history.

EosPad: All notes, documents, and creative writing across all your saved tabs.

EosNews: Your complete list of RSS feed sources, your saved folders, and all bookmarked articles.

EosOrbit: Your saved favorite items, custom collections, search history, and saved music playlists.

Eospiral: Your complete game save file, including your player's progress, level, and items.

EosReader: Your reading preferences (like theme and font size) and any text you highlight and save as an annotation.

Important Warning: Because this data is 100% local, it is never backed up to a server. If you uninstall the Eos extension or clear your browser's data, all this information will be permanently and irretrievably deleted. We have no way to recover it for you.

2. External Data Transmission (The Only Exceptions)

Eos is offline-first, but two types of features require an internet connection to function. In all cases, your data is sent directly from your browser to the third-party service, not to us.

2.1. Your Google Gemini API Key

The AI features in EosScholar and EosPad (like the chatbot, quiz generator, and text summarizer) are powered by your own personal Google Gemini API key.

Storage: Your API key is stored only in your browser's local storage. We, the developers of Eos, never see, collect, or have access to it.

Transmission: When you use an AI feature, your browser sends your prompt (e.g., your question) and your API key directly to Google's API (generativelanguage.googleapis.com). This interaction is between you and Google. Your use of the Gemini API is subject to Google's Privacy Policy and Gemini Terms of Service.

Responsibility and Costs: You, the user, are solely responsible for the procurement and use of your own Google Gemini API key. You are responsible for understanding which version of the API you are using (e.g., free tier, Pro models) and any costs associated with it. The developer of Eos is not a party to your agreement with Google and is not liable for any charges, fees, or bills you may incur from your API usage. All costs are your exclusive responsibility.

2.2. Anonymous Search & Feed Fetching

The EosOrbit and EosNews modules fetch content from public databases.

Transmission: When you search in EosOrbit or refresh your feeds in EosNews, your browser sends an anonymous search query (e.g., "History of Rome") or a feed URL directly to third-party services like the Internet Archive, Open Library, LibriVox, Gutenberg, or a CORS proxy to fetch the data.

Privacy: No personal data, API keys, or identifying information from your Eos extension is ever sent with these requests.

3. Extension Permissions Explained

Eos requests several permissions to make its features work. Here is exactly why each one is needed:

storage: This is the most important permission. It allows the extension to save all your local data (as detailed in Section 1).

tabs: This permission is used only for the Eos Compass feature to allow you to search through your currently open tabs.

scripting & host_permissions: ["<all_urls>"]: These are the most sensitive permissions, and we treat them with extreme care.

Purpose: These are required only for the Eos Compass (the floating search widget) to appear on other webpages.

Your Control: To protect your privacy, this feature is OFF by default. The extension will only ask for these permissions if you explicitly go into the Eos settings and enable the "Eos Compass." If you never enable this feature, the extension never has permission to read or inject scripts into other websites.

alarms: This permission is used only for the Pomodoro timer in EosScholar and the Mode Scheduler to function correctly in the background.

4. Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy in the future. Any changes will be posted in an updated README.md or an in-extension notification.
