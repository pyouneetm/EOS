Eos: The All-in-One New Tab Productivity Suite (later known as Minimalist-HomePage)

 ( https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/minimalist-homepage/eagkdcnpaaiokkgamfnkhedhighjkeep ) EOS A beautifully designed, highly customizable new tab page for your browser that combines productivity, relaxation, and entertainment. With a focus on privacy and a rich feature set, it transforms your new tab into a personal dashboard.

Eos is not just a new tab page; it's a complete, offline-first productivity, learning, and discovery environment built directly into your browser. It replaces your new tab with a "sentient" dashboard that acts as a launchpad for a powerful suite of integrated applications.

Every piece of data, from your to-do lists and notes to your API keys and game saves, is stored 100% locally in your browser. Nothing is ever sent to an external server, ensuring your privacy.

Core Features

The Eos App Suite: A collection of powerful, standalone "apps" for learning, creativity, and discovery, all accessible from your new tab.

The Eos Compass: A floating, ambient search widget that gives you access to your open tabs and search from any webpage (opt-in).

Deep Customization: Control everything from themes, colors, and fonts to widget visibility and background images.

Offline-First & Private: Your data is yours. All state is saved locally. AI features require your own API key, which is also stored locally and only sent directly to Google.
